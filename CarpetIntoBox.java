// Given a carpet of size a * b [length * breadth] and a box of size c * d, one has to fit the carpet in the box in the minimum number of moves. A move is to fold the carpet in half, either by length or breadth.

// One can even turn the carpet by 90 degrees any number of times, wonâ€™t be counted as a move.

// Example: Box = 6 * 10 Carpet = 8 * 12

// Output: No of moves = 1

// Fold the carpet by breadth, 12/2 so now carpet is 6*8 and can fit fine.
